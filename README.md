# MS-Excel_portfolio_project

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio project on bike sales analysis across different regions, education levels, marital status, age groups, and more. In this project, I have performed data exploration, data cleaning, and visualized the data through data analysis. Additionally, I have created a dashboard using MS Excel to showcase insights related to marital status and education.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a relatively large dataset containing information about bike sales. It includes various attributes such as region, education level, marital status, age, and other relevant factors. The dataset is stored in the file bike_sales_data.csv.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:

### Data Exploration:
Understanding the structure and contents of the dataset, identifying missing values, and gaining initial insights into the data.

### Data Cleaning:
Handling missing or erroneous data points, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for analysis.

### Data Visualization:
Creating visualizations to explore relationships between variables and discover patterns and trends in the data.

### Dashboard Creation:
Building an interactive dashboard in MS Excel to present key findings related to marital status and education.

## Technologies Used
MS Excel: Utilized to analyse, visualise and create the interactive dashboard.

## Conclusion
This portfolio project demonstrates my skills in data analysis and visualization. The interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into bike sales across different regions, education levels, marital status, and age groups. Feel free to explore the notebooks and dashboard to get a comprehensive understanding of the analysis and findings.
